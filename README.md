<h1> This is a Jira / Kanban like board for my personal use</h1>

The reason I built this:
<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate my C++ skills (not to the full extent of my skills, still :)</li>
  <li>Have a board I could use for my daily uses.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
I'm looking to keep it updated, as I might want to add more functionalities and
update the UI.

Project uses vcpkg.
